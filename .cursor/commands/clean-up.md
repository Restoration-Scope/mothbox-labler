# Code Clean up

### Purpose

- review the target code, most likely the current file or a portion of code
- your goal is to do a lightweight round of organization and clean up.
- if you see logic blocks that are agnostic, please turn them into helper functions at the bottom of the file.
- You'll follow the general rules of the project e.g. high level/entry fns at the top, atomic/helper fns at the bottom.
- You will make sure that there's no code duplication but without making things overly complex for the sake of abstractions.
- BY NO MEANS YOU CAN'T BREAK EXECUTION FLOW. To ensure that you will:
  1. make a list of the improvmeents
  2. make a list of the logic flow that will be impacted by the improvement lines
  3. execute the improvements
  4. verify the logic flow is intact.
     If by some raeson you break something or are concerned something might have gone wrong you will say so
