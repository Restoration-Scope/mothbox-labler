# Code Clean up

### Purpose

- review the target code, most likely the current file or a portion of code
- your goal is to do a lightweight round of organization and clean up.
- if you see logic blocks that are agnostic, please turn them into helper functions at the bottom of the file.
- make sure that the code is organized top to bottom. from entry/bigger to atomic/helper/smaller at the bottom. I should read it almost in call order
