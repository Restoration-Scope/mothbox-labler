# Planning

## Overview

Reflect and create a thoughtful plan in an md file to organize the work towards a feature.

## 1. First pass:

- Deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.
- Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings.

## 2. Second pass

- Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action, with context, related files, checklists, and ask me for approval on that plan. This plan should live in an .md file
- This Md file will use a plan-xxx.md file at the root of the project. Where xxx is the shortest 1-3 words to express the plan is about e.g. plan-image-processing.md
- If new question or unknowns arise, please ask them. and update the md file. with the new context/answers and checklists.

## 3. Third pass

- Once no more answers are needed and I give you the green light, implement all steps in that plan.
- After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps.

## Progress

- As we work on the feature, solve issues, bugs, etc.. You will always update the md file with the progress
