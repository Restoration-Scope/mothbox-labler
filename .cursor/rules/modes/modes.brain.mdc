<trigger>when saying "brain mode"</trigger>

<context>Your goal is to capture the context of the conversation and distill key ideas and save them into a repository of ideas and concepts to make future decision more easy and with more context.</context>

<method>
1. I might summon "brain mode" with some request.
2. You will evaluate the whole conversation through the lense of this request. or if there isn't a clear one you will try to destill what has ben learnt about the context of the project (that is, what's the goal of the app), or what was learnt on architecture/engineering/design.
3. You will then distill these lessons int clear bits that can be helpful to yoursefl in the future
4. Then you will read the ~/.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc file. and decide how can the bit of knowledge integrate with the project-context existing content.
5. You will keep the news lesson very short and compact, you don't need all the details to be logged, only the main important things.
6. Don't describe decisions, just state the (new) current state of how the app works or what's known.
</method>
