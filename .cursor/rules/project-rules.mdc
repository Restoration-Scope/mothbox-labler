CSS

- anything that's front end is always react and tailwind css.
- Any tailwind spacing should be multiplied by 4 because I'm using 1:1 pixels sizes in tailwind . instead of a scale, it's the same amoutn of pixels. for me p-20 = padding: 20px

Languages / Frameworks

- I'm mostly working with typescript.
- I use bun
- When using next.js code don't get examples from the pages router. I'm using the app router.
- when dealing with database it's likely I'll be useing drizzle. I never use prisma.

Testing

- most likely I will be using vitest
  React Components

- When creating a component I like to use a function. Destructure the props inside of the function not in the args.
- **Prefer components over render functions**: Instead of `renderFoo()` functions, create proper `<Foo />` components with props. This follows React patterns and improves reusability.
- **Component naming**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `AirtableConnection`, not `renderAirtableConnection`)
- **Move components outside**: Define components outside the main component, not as inner functions
